## Research Direction
My research focuses on the **formalization of compositional reasoning** within neural architectures. I am specifically interested in how **category-theoretic structures**—such as functors, monoidal composition, and natural transformations—can serve as inductive biases to improve out-of-distribution generalization and robust multi-step reasoning in Large Language Models.

## Research Interests
*   **Compositional AI**: Inductive biases for architectural modularity.
*   **Category Theory in ML**: Functorial semantics and latent program networks.
*   **Agentic Reasoning**: Multi-agent orchestration and tool-use verification.
*   **Finance & LLMs**: Domain-specific reasoning in credit and macro research.
